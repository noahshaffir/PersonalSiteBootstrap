            Hello! My name is Noah and I'm a Computer Science student at Wilfrid Laurier University. 
            I am interested in learning more about software engineering and full-stack development.
            If you want to learn more about me, check out my projects below or feel free to reach out.
            When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music, reading newspaper articles about foreign policy or spending time with friends.
